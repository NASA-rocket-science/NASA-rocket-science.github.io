          <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Unique Opportunities for Scientific Research. Sounding rockets carry scientific instruments into space along parabolic trajectories, providing nearly vertical traversals along their upleg and downleg, while appearing to "hover" near their apogee location. Whereas the overall time in space is brief (typically 5-20 minutes), for a well-placed scientific experiment launched into a geophysical phenomena of interest, the short time and low vehicle speeds are more than adequate (in some cases they are ideal) to carry out a successful scientific experiment. Furthermore, there are some important regions of space that are too low to be sampled by satellites (i.e., the lower ionosphere/thermosphere and mesosphere below 120 km altitude) and thus sounding rockets provide the only platforms that can carry out direct in-situ measurements in these regions. Astronomy, solar, and planetary science missions include sophisticated telescopes with optional joy-stick operated, sub-arc-second pointing for >5 minute continuous observations of astronomical objects, including those too close to the sun for Hubble or EUVE observations. Microgravity missions are carried out on high altitude, free-fall parabolic trajectories which provide ideal microgravity environments without the vibrations frequently encountered on human-tendered platforms.</p>
